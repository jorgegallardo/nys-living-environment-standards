        ["name": "Key Idea 1", "content": "The central purpose of scientific inquiry is to develop explanations of natural phenomena in a continuing and creative process."],
        ["name": "1.1a", "content": "Scientific explanations are built by combining evidence that can be observed with what people already know about the world."],
        ["name": "1.1b", "content": "Learning about the historical development of scientific concepts or about individuals who have contributed to scientific knowledge provides a better understanding of scientific inquiry and the relationship between science and society."],
        ["name": "1.1c", "content": "Science provides knowledge, but values are also essential to making effective and ethical decisions about the application of scientific knowledge."],
        ["name": "1.2a", "content": "Inquiry involves asking questions and locating, interpreting, and processing information from a variety of sources."],
        ["name": "1.2b", "content": "Inquiry involves making judgments about the reliability of the source and relevance of information."],
        ["name": "1.3a", "content": "Scientific explanations are accepted when they are consistent with experimental and observational evidence and when they lead to accurate predictions."],
        ["name": "1.3b", "content": "All scientific explanations are tentative and subject to change or improvement. Each new bit of evidence can create more questions than it answers. This leads to increasingly better understanding of how things work in the living world."],
        ["name": "1.4a", "content": "Well-accepted theories are ones that are supported by different kinds of scientific investigations often involving the contributions of individuals from different disciplines."],
        ["name": "Key Idea 2", "content": "Beyond the use of reasoning and consensus, scientific inquiry involves the testing of proposed explanations involving the use of conventional techniques and procedures and usually requiring considerable ingenuity."],
        ["name": "2.2a", "content": "Development of a research plan involves researching background information and understanding the major concepts in the area being investigated. Recommendations for methodologies, use of technologies, proper equipment, and safety precautions should also be included."],
        ["name": "2.3a", "content": "Hypotheses are predictions based upon both research and observation."],
        ["name": "2.3b", "content": "Hypotheses are widely used in science for determining what data to collect and as a guide for interpreting the data."],
        ["name": "2.3c", "content": "Development of a research plan for testing a hypothesis requires planning to avoid bias (e.g., repeated trials, large sample size, and objective data-collection techniques)."],
        ["name": "Key Idea 3", "content": "The observations made while testing proposed explanations, when analyzed using conventional and invented methods, provide new insights into natural phenomena."],
        ["name": "3.1a", "content": "Interpretation of data leads to development of additional hypotheses, the formulation of generalizations, or explanations of natural phenomena."],
        ["name": "3.4a", "content": "Hypotheses are valuable, even if they turn out not to be true, because they may lead to further investigation."],
        ["name": "3.4b", "content": "Claims should be questioned if the data are based on samples that are very small, biased, or inadequately controlled or if the conclusions are based on the faulty, incomplete, or misleading use of numbers."],
        ["name": "3.4c", "content": "Claims should be questioned if fact and opinion are intermingled, if adequate evidence is not cited, or if the conclusions do not follow logically from the evidence given."],
        ["name": "3.5a", "content": "One assumption of science is that other individuals could arrive at the same explanation if they had access to similar evidence. Scientists make the results of their investigations public; they should describe the investigations in ways that enable others to repeat the investigations."],
        ["name": "3.5b", "content": "Scientists use peer review to evaluate the results of scientific investigations and the explanations proposed by other scientists. They analyze the experimental procedures, examine the evidence, identify faulty reasoning, point out statements that go beyond the evidence, and suggest alternative explanations for the same observations."]
